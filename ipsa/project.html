<h1>Information on Final Project</h1>
<p>The goal of the final project is to do some concrete Python implementation and documenting it in a short report.  The project can be done in groups with 1-3 students.  There are three deliverables for the final project that should be handed in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Python code</em>. Either plain Python 3 code in one or more .py files, or Python 3 code embedded into a Jupyter file.</li>
<li><em>A report</em> - <strong>maximum 4 pages</strong>. The front page must contain the information listed below (the front page does not count towards the page count).</li>
<li><em>Visualization of data</em>. E.g. matplotlib output. The plots should be included in an appendix to the report, that does not count towards the page count, or alternatively embedded in a Jupyter file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project report</h2>
<p>The project report must contain the below front page (not counted in the 4 pages). Make sure you read and understand the note on plagiarism.  The report can be written in Danish and English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="project-front-page.pdf" target="_blank">project-front-page.pdf</a> |
<a href="project-front-page.docx" target="_blank">project-front-page.docx</a> |
<a href="project-front-page.tex" target="_blank">project-front-page.tex</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Project descriptions</h2>
<p>You can choose any of the projects listed in the menu as your final project.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of handin</h2>
<p>The project deliverables will be scored according to the below rubric.</p>

      <td>Overall good report but for some aspects the level of detail/precision could be higher</td>
      <td>Solid report, containing reflection upon the implementation
    done, discussion of the Python modules used, the design choices
    made, discussion of the structure of the code, what were the
    hardest parts, what is missing, and discussion of testing and
    visualization</td>
