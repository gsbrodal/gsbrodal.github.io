# Handins

The weekly handins and the final project can be handed in under **Course Tools > Assignments**. Both the weekly handins and the final project can be done in groups of up to three persons.

Before you can hand in your assignments on the page you need to register your handin group and exercise class under **Course Tools > Groups**.

The handins are stated together with the ordinary exercises on the "Exercises" page (see menu).

**The top of each handin must contain the names of all group members who contributed to the handin.**

**The filename of each submission must contain the full names of all group members and study id.**
