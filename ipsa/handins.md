# Handins

The weekly handins are stated together with the ordinary exercises on the "Exercises" page (see menu). Both the weekly handins and the final project can be done in groups of up to three persons.

The weekly handins and the final project can be handed in under **Course Tools > Assignments** on the Brightspace course page on [brightspace.au.dk](https://brightspace.au.dk/). Before you can hand in your assignments on the page you need to register your handin group under **Course Tools > Groups** on Brightspace.

**The top of each handin must contain the names of all group members who contributed to the handin.**

**The filename of each submission must contain the study ids and full names of all group members.**
