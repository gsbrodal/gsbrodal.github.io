program to test your solution during the exam, where it tests if your code generates the expected output for a set of test inputs provided. The exam should be handed in as a single zip file (how to create a .zip file on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac" target="_blank">macOS</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files" target="_blank">Windows</a>).</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>The grade reflects an <em>overall assessment</em> of the final implementation project and the final exam.</p>
<p>The final exam will contribute roughly 3/4 to the final grade. The result of the final exam must meet the minimum requirements for acceptance to be able to pass the course.</p>
<p>The project done during the course will also count towards the reexam.</p>
