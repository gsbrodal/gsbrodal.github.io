<h1>Basic literature</h1>
<p>The material for the course primarily consists of slides from the lectures and online documentation available from <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">python.org</a> and related sites.</p>
<p>The following book gives a good background for the course, but it is <em>not</em> mandatory to buy the book for attending the course. The initial chapters give an introduction to (Python) programming, whereas the later chapters focus more on applications. In the course we will be covering more aspects of the Python programming language than the book does, whereas we will not cover much of the later chapters.</p>

<p>The major updates are that the examples changed from using Python 3.5 to now using Python 3.8 (in the Spring 2022 we use Python 3.10), Chapter 4 from the 2nd edition has been split into three chapters (the new chapters, Chapter 6 "Recursion and Global Variables" and Chapter 7 "Modules and Files", were previosly subsections of Chapter 4), Chapters 19 and 20 in the 2nd Edition have been merged to a single Chapter 21 in the 3rd Edition, and a new Chapter 23 on "Exploring Data with Pandas" has been added. The initial chapters of the book have been expanded to make it a gentler introduction to programming.</p>
