# Basic literature

The material for the course primarily consists of slides from the lectures and online documentation available from [python.org](https://www.python.org) and related sites.

The following book gives a good background for the course, but it is _not_ mandatory to buy the book for attending the course. The initial chapters give an introduction to (Python) programming, whereas the later chapters focus more on applications. In the course we will be covering more aspects of the Python programming language than the book does, whereas we will not cover much of the later chapters.
