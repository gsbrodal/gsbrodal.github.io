# Note on plagiarism

Since the evaluation of the handins and code will be part of the final grade in the course / prerequisite to go to the exam, plagiarism in your handins will be considered cheating. Whenever adopting code or text from elsewhere you must state this and give a reference/link to your source. It is perfectly fine to search information and adopt partial solutions from the internet — actually, this is encouraged — but always state your source in your handin. Also discussing your problems with your handins with other students is perfectly fine, but remember each group should handin their own solution. If you are in doubt if you solution will be very similar to another group because you discussed the details, please put a remark that you have discussed your solution with other groups.

# Note on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)

GAI has become widespread available as a tool to increase productivity, in particular in the domain of programming, like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for Visual Studio Code.

During the course you are allowed to use GAI, but remember to cite the usage of GAI in your handins (e.g., as comments in your code). Make sure that you do not completely copy a GAI answer into your handin. Your handins should represent your work with the exercises, not how easy it is for a GAI.

At the final exam GAI it is not allowed.
