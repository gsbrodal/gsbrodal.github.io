<h1>General information about Python</h1>
<p>To develop Python programs you need to be able to <em>edit</em> Python programs and to be able to <em>execute</em> Python programs.</p>
<p>Editing can in principle be done using any basic text editor like Notepad on Windows, but in practice one would like a more advanced editor that automatically formats and highlights your program, and gives more advanced editing. Examples are IDLE and Spyder, which automatically will be installed depending on if you install CPython from <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">python.org</a> or Anaconda as described below.</p>
<p>For discussions of alternative IDEs for Python code development try a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=best+python+ides&amp;oq=best+python+ides" target="_blank">Google search for "best python ides"</a>.</p>
<p>To execute a Python program you need an <em>interpreter</em>. The reference implementation and most widely used implementation is CPython which can be installed from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank">python.org/downloads</a> or [www.anaconda.com/download}(https://www.anaconda.com/download) as described below. But other implementations exist, e.g. PyPy as mentioned below. An overview can be found on <a href="https://www.python.org/download/alternatives" target="_blank">www.python.org/download/alternatives</a>.</p>
