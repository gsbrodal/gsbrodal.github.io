# Project V - Open topic

You can also define your own project. There are some aspects that need to be addressed.

* Some minimal amount of Python 3 code must be produced.

* Use at least two different Python modules.

* Some data must be visualized, e.g using matplotlib, but any [visualization module](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries) or domain specific library, like for [chemistry](https://github.com/lmmentel/awesome-python-chemistry), can be used.

You need to get your project description approved by sending an e-mail to the lecturer Gerth St&oslash;lting Brodal at [gerth@cs.au.dk](mailto:gerth@cs.au.dk).
