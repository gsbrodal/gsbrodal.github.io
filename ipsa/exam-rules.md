# Exam information

**The exam is a 5 hours, written exam, with aids, including computer, headphone and internet**.

The ordinary exam is in June. The reexam is in August.

A prerequisite for attending the exam is the approval of 10 mandatory assignments and submission of 1 implementation project. The handins and project can be done in groups of up to three persons.

The exam will be a set of programming exercises, where you have to provide Python code that solves various problems of varying hardness.

See previous exams for examples of exercises. The exam is provided as a zip file containing exercises A.py, B.py... [`__`README`__`.txt](__README__.txt) and a [run_tests.py](run_tests.py)
program to test your solution during the exam, where it tests if your code generates the expected output for a set of test inputs provided. The exam should be handed in as a single zip file (how to create a .zip file on [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac) and [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files)).

_Communication with others about the exam is not permitted during the exam. Students are required to have
[ITX-Flex](https://studerende.au.dk/en/digital-eksamen/information-about-itx-flex/) turned on throughout the entire exam._

_It is exam cheating, if you use AI for the exam (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.), as the exam assignment has not been solved independently and individually._

## ITX-Flex and Linux

The following information concerning the exam is taken from the study portal's [Important Information about Exams](https://studerende.au.dk/en/studies/subject-portals/computer-science/examination/important-information-about-exams):

> _If you use the Linux operating system, it is not possible to activate the ITX-Flex digital monitoring system._

> _When you arrive for the written on-site exam, you must notify the site supervisor about you using Linux. You will then be placed under more strict supervision by the exam site supervisor during the exam._

> _It is your responsibility to make sure that the site supervisor is aware that you are using Linux._

## Curriculum

The course curriculum for the exam consists of the slides covered during the course and available in the "Course plan" (see menu), the topic covered in the implementation project, and the topics covered in the mandatory handins.

## Grading

The grade reflects an _overall assessment_ of the final implementation project and the final exam.

The final exam contributes 80% to the final grade and the implementation project 20%. The result of the final exam must meet the minimum requirements for acceptance to be able to pass the course.

The implementation project done during the course will also count towards the reexam.
