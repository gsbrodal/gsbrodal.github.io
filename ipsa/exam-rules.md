#  Exam information

**The exam is a 5 hours, written exam, with aids, including computer, headphone and internet**.

The ordinary exam is in June. The reexam is in August.

A prerequisite for attending the exam is the approval of 10 mandatory assignments and submission of 1 implementation project. The handins and project can be done in groups of up to three persons.

The exam will be a set of programming exercises, where you have to provide Python code that solves various problems of varying hardness.

See previous exams for examples of exercises. The exam is provided as a zip file containing exercises A.py, B.py... [`__`README`__`.txt](__README__.txt) and a [run_tests.py](run_tests.py)
program to test your solution during the exam, where it tests if your code generates the expected output for a set of test inputs provided. The exam should be handed in as a single zip file (how to create a .zip file on [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac) and [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc)).

_Communication with others about the exam is not permitted during the exam. Students are required to bring their own PC and have
[WISEflow Device Monitor](https://studerende.au.dk/en/wiseflow/) turned on throughout the entire exam. Tablets are not allowed._

_Accessing the internet is not allowed during the exam, except for downloading the exam questions, submitting your exam answers, and for running the WISEflow Device Monitor._

_It is exam cheating, if you use an AI assistant for the exam (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.). Locally installed AI assistants on your computer are also not allowed._

## WISEflow and Linux

WISEflow has limited support for Linux, but according to the [WISEflow support page](https://wiseflow.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12151266178844-Minimum-Requirements-for-Applications) the WISEflow Device Monitor can run on some versions of Linux.

## Curriculum

The course curriculum for the exam consists of the slides covered during the course and available in the "Course plan" (see menu), the topic covered in the implementation project, and the topics covered in the mandatory handins.

## Grading

The grade reflects an _overall assessment_ of the final implementation project and the final exam.

The final exam contributes 80% to the final grade and the implementation project 20%. The result of the final exam must meet the minimum requirements for acceptance to be able to pass the course.

The implementation project done during the course will also count towards the reexam.

## Files to bring to the exam

Since your are not allowed to access the internet during the exam, it is important that you before the exam already have downloaded

* A working Python installation.
* Relevant lanuage documentation, e.g., from [docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/) 
  download [python-3.14-docs-pdf-a4.zip](https://docs.python.org/3/archives/python-3.14-docs-pdf-a4.zip).
* [Course slides]](https://gsbrodal.github.io/ipsa/slides/all-slides.pdf).
* Your solutions to exercises made throughout the semester.
